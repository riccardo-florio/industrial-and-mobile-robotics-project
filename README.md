# Industrial and mobile robotics project

This project focuses on the development of robotics, specifically in two main areas: industrial robotics and mobile robotics. In the industrial robotics part, the project aims to understand and enhance the capabilities of anthropomorphic robots used in tasks like automation in production lines and object handling. This involves studying the robot's mechanical structure, articulations, and control methods, as well as developing algorithms for specific tasks like picking and placing objects.

In the mobile robotics part, the project is geared towards creating robots that can autonomously navigate pre-established environments. These robots are increasingly important in various applications like logistics, exploration of challenging environments, and much more. The project involves designing robots with navigation algorithms, enabling them to sense their surroundings and plan safe and efficient movements.

Overall, the project addresses technical and conceptual challenges in automation, with a primary goal of exploring the potential of anthropomorphic and mobile robots in industrial and mobile robotics contexts. In the report, you will find a detailed overview of the work done, the results achieved, and the future prospects in advanced robot research and development.
